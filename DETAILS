Project Overview:

The Safe Anchor Analysis Project is a data-driven initiative developed to analyze and interpret trends related to abuse cases handled by certified professionals such as psychologists, trauma counselors, and social workers. This project is part of the broader Experts for Abuse Victims initiative, a platform designed to connect survivors of abuse with qualified experts, enhance response systems, and promote evidence-based decision-making through analytics. The project leverages real-world data to uncover patterns in victim demographics, offender relationships, severity levels, and case outcomes, offering valuable insights for policy makers, welfare organizations, and mental health professionals.

Objectives:

• To analyze patterns of abuse by type, region, gender, and offender.

• To evaluate expert involvement and case distribution among different professional categories.

• To examine case duration, outcome, and severity levels.

• To identify high-risk cases and vulnerable demographics for prioritization.

• To support data-informed interventions for victim protection and recovery.

Analytical Approach:

Data Collection: Data was gathered from verified expert case reports, communication logs, and institutional records.

Data Cleaning: Performed using excel and power query to handle duplicates, missing data, and formatting inconsistencies.

Feature Engineering: Created analytical fields such as Risk Score, Severity Level, and Case Duration to enhance interpretability.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted to uncover relationships among variables and identify significant abuse trends.

Visualization & Reporting: Insights were summarized into interactive visuals and reports to support social welfare decision-making.

Tools & Technologies:

• Power BI: Visualization and reporting

• Excel: Data aggregation and cross-verification

Key Insights:

Abuse Type Distribution: • The most common forms of abuse were Child Abuse (15) and Financial Abuse (11).
• Other reported cases included Domestic Violence (9), Emotional Abuse (8), and Sexual Abuse (7).

• These figures highlight child and financial abuse as priority areas for intervention.

Expert Engagement: • Social Workers (18) handled the majority of cases, followed by Trauma Counselors (11) and Clinical Psychologists (8).
• This shows the critical frontline role social workers play in managing abuse cases.

Regional Analysis: • The North Central region (23 cases) recorded the highest number of cases.
• Lower numbers in other regions may indicate limited awareness, underreporting, or fewer response resources.

Gender Breakdown: • The project found 26 female and 24 male victims, reflecting that abuse affects both genders almost equally.

Severity Level: • High-severity cases (16) dominated the dataset, followed by Low (14), Moderate (11), and Critical (9).

• This shows that most victims faced serious or prolonged abuse, requiring sustained intervention.

Offender Patterns: • The Spouse (20) category was the most frequent offender, followed by Unknown Individuals (9) and Parents (6).
• Domestic and intimate partner abuse remain the most common, underscoring the need for household-level prevention strategies.

Case Duration and Outcome: • Case durations ranged between 140 and 312 days, with many marked as Ongoing Counseling, Pending Review, or Closed.
• This suggests that abuse-related recovery and resolution are long-term processes that need continuous support.

Demographic Overview: • Youngest victim: 6 years • Oldest victim: 65 years • Total victims: 50 • Risk Score range: 13 (minimum) to 74 (maximum)
Observations:

High Prevalence of Child and Financial Abuse: These two categories accounted for the largest share of reported cases, emphasizing the need for focused child protection and financial empowerment programs.
Social Workers Are the Primary Responders: Their high level of engagement shows they are central to the victim response process but may also be experiencing workload strain.
Regional Imbalance in Reporting: The North Central region’s dominance in case numbers suggests that other regions may lack adequate awareness or reporting structures.
Abuse Affects All Genders: The near-equal gender distribution reveals that men also face abuse, challenging common stereotypes and reinforcing the need for gender-inclusive interventions.
Severity Levels Indicate Serious Harm: Most cases were high severity, pointing to a pattern of late reporting or prolonged abuse before help is sought.
Domestic Abuse Dominates: Spousal and familial abuse being the most frequent aligns with global patterns of intimate partner violence, highlighting the home as a high-risk environment.
Long Case Durations Reflect Complexity: The extended time required for resolution indicates both the emotional and procedural depth involved in abuse recovery.
Wide Risk Score Variation: The broad range (13–74) suggests diverse victim experiences and underscores the need for case prioritization systems.
Active but Overstretched Support Network: The project data shows that while professionals are responsive, there’s a need for better distribution of responsibilities and case load balancing.
Broad Age Range of Victims: Victims span from children to elderly individuals, emphasizing that abuse is not limited to a specific demographic.
Recommendation:

Strengthen Early Reporting Mechanisms: Create easily accessible channels (hotlines, digital forms, and community centers) to encourage early disclosure and timely intervention.
Expand Regional Outreach Programs: Increase awareness and reporting in underrepresented regions through education campaigns and local partnerships.
Enhance Family-Based Interventions: Since most offenders are relatives or spouses, implement family therapy, relationship counseling, and anger management programs.
Empower Social Workers and Counselors: Provide training, psychological support, and better tools for social workers to manage heavy caseloads and prevent burnout.
Adopt a Risk-Based Prioritization Model: Use risk scores to automatically flag and fast-track high-severity cases for immediate expert attention.
Develop a Centralized Case Tracking System: Implement a digital case management tool to monitor case progress, duration, and expert actions across organizations.
Policy Support and Funding: Advocate for increased funding for mental health and abuse response programs, alongside government-backed reporting policies.
Continuous Data Monitoring: Update datasets regularly and integrate a feedback mechanism between analysts and field experts to improve data accuracy.
Public Awareness and Education: Conduct sensitization campaigns that focus on recognizing abuse signs, understanding legal rights, and accessing help safely.
Ensure Ethical Data Practices: Protect victim identity through anonymization, limited data access, and secure storage — maintaining both privacy and analytical integrity.
Impact of safe anchor analysis project The Safe Anchor Analysis Project demonstrates how data analytics can support social good by uncovering patterns, guiding interventions, and influencing welfare policies. Through its findings, the project offers clear directions for preventive strategies, capacity building, and evidence-based resource allocation, ultimately contributing to safer and more responsive community systems.

Key Learnings:

• Handling sensitive data requires both analytical precision and ethical responsibility.

• Data visualization and storytelling transform complex information into actionable insights.

• Collaboration between analysts and field experts produces more realistic, people-centered outcomes.
